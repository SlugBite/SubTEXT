# SubTEXT CMS
Subtext is not a blogging platform nor a static website builder; it is a modular content creation system.

The project is still in the planning phase.

Currently, database architecture and directory structure are nearly complete. Next is core development. Subtext utilizes a php framework. Yii2 is an option still, but CodeIgnitor is the likely choice. Lean and robust.

The biggest feature of Subtext is a content type generator accessible via the admin to quickly create new content types. Subtext makes no assumptions about what it will be used for beyond the default setup.
