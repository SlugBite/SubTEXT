# Subtext
The Subtext Content Management System is not an ordinary CMS. In fact, it's number one purpose is to be more of a CMS than any other.

The project is still in a planning phase. Currently, database overview and directory structure are nearly complete. The next step will be beginning core development. Instead of going at the php with a from-scratch approach I have decided to utilize a php framework. Yii2 is an option still, but CodeIgnitor is the front runner.

Subtext is a CMS that aims to tackle the voids left by nearly all other content management systems when it comes to content. It's not a blogging platform nor a static website builder; it is a modular content creation system.

It's biggest feature will be a content type generator accessible via the admin interface that allows for quick, normalized creation of content types. Subtext makes no assumptions about what it will be used for beyond the default setup.

### Straight out of the box, Subtext comes with:

	- Taxonomies like categories, tags, and topics
	- Default Entries for blog posts or news articles
	- Full meta data support at the post and SEO levels
	- Static pages with a hierarchical flow
	- Hierarchical category structure
	- Pretty URLs by default
	- Admin-based asset management for images, videos, and audio files
	- Admin-based interface for creating new content types that integrate with existing taxonomies or create new ones
	- A themed design capable of quick interchangeability

This will be a long process. I would welcome like-minded developers to join me on this project, particularly those experienced with AJAX and JavaScript.
